\section{Future work}

\paragraph{OSIRISv4.1}
Trying to process large data sets, long list of images, OSIRISv4.1 has a severe 
memory leak on large data sets. Which currently must be mitigated by splitting 
the list or run a program on the side which initialises OSIRIS for every image.

While automating the OSIRISv4.1 I encountered errors where the current image
failed, but no errors was issued and errors was given for the next images, which
processed correctly.  This caused some issues during my automation process.
This was mitigated by avoiding error handling all together and creating a second
script which is run after all OSIRISv4.1 processes has ended.


\paragraph{Further development of BIQA and IQA}
Current development of this project and its tools is serialised tasks in Matlab
which takes a long time to run.  Processing 12.000 images on a Debian 7 Wheezy,
using 6GB RAM and four 2.3GHz Cores takes approximately 24 hours with IQA and 18
hours with BIQA.  Pre-processing the images using the automated python script
which tries up to three configurations per image takes also approximately 3-4
hours using OSIRISv4.1.

All of this has to be streamlined into a multihreaded application in order to
reduce the time spent idling. With a tailored application for this, the time
spent processing the entire data set should be shortened to maximum a couple of
hours.
