This section explains how the tools created in this paper works and calculates
its metrics.
BIQA and IQA were developed as part of two separate projects and joined
together for this paper.  BIQA\cite{biqa} was developed to explore how well 
the metrics in the ISO 29794-6 \cite{iso} is for classification
purposes. The metrics are summarised in table \ref{tab:indclas}.
The IQA\cite{iqa} project was to reverse engineer the methods proposed by Hugo
Proenca\cite{hugo} which utilised a set of metrics to estimate the quality of 
the iris images in visible spectrum.
