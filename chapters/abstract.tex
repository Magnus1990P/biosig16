This paper explores how different image metrics differs in the ability 
to classify periocular images in the visible wavelength spectrum.  There 
were two extraction tools created for this paper. BIQA\cite{biqa} and
IQA\cite{iqa}.  The metrics extracted was then tested for their ability classify
the data sets into "good" and "bad" images.  BIQA is based on the works of
various authors and IQA is a reverse engineering of Hugo Proencas 
paper\cite{hugo}.

The results shows that several metrics were not applicable for classification of
images focusing on the periocular region and some performed very well for
classifying the data set and is summarised in table \ref{tab:appl} in the
conclusion.
